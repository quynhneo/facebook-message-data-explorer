# Facebook message data explorer (phân tích tin nhắn facebook tiếng Việt)

Load facebook data for a group chat (json files) into data frame, properly decode unicode Vietnamese, and explore the data (number of messages daily, monthly by senders, plot frequently used words and emoticons). 

From the messages, you can extract an interaction matrix between users: Who is mostlikely to respond to whom in the group.
